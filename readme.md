Buncome County Airbnb Bivariate map

Data provided by
Point: Inside Airbnb
Area level: Zoning Districts- City of Asheville Open Data Portal

Functions: I used customized CSS styling codes to expand the map full screen and to style the legend. I used Font Awesome to add the Airbnb icon for point marker visualization and assigned a style class to each type of Airbnb property. I used ColorBrewer to symbolize geographic features with a sequential color palette Purples. I changed the font from Times New Roman to Titillium Web from the Google Font library.
